# Providers in NestJS

## What is a Provider?
A **provider** in NestJS is a class annotated with `@Injectable()`, making it available for dependency injection within the application. Providers are primarily used for services, repositories, factories, and helpers.

## Defining a Provider
A provider is created using a standard class and decorated with `@Injectable()`:
Think of providers as classes in a module which help you add business logic to your module.
This CLASS has the responsibilty of interacting with the database as well as other providers. Providers can be of different types as well: service, repository, factory and so on. Seperating code into different forms is that it clears seperation of concerns.

# Business Logic in NestJS

## **User Management**
- User registration with password hashing  
- User authentication and session management  
- Role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Email verification and password reset  

## **E-Commerce & Orders**
- Cart management (adding/removing items, applying discounts)  
- Order validation and payment processing  
- Order status updates and notifications  
- Inventory stock validation before order confirmation  
- Refund and return policy enforcement  

## **Finance & Transactions**
- Loan eligibility check based on salary and credit score  
- Fraud detection and prevention  
- Dynamic tax and shipping calculations  
- Subscription and recurring payment handling  

## **Content & Notifications**
- Automated email and SMS notifications  
- Scheduled content publishing  
- User activity tracking and logging  
- Multi-language content handling  

## **Analytics & Recommendations**
- Personalized product recommendations  
- Customer segmentation for marketing  
- Sales performance and revenue tracking  
- AI-driven sentiment analysis  

## **General Application Logic**
- Data validation and sanitization  
- Rate limiting and request throttling  
- Background job processing (e.g., sending bulk emails)  
- API request caching and optimization  

You should never write business logic inside the controller. 


```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class MyService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello, NestJS!';
  }
}
