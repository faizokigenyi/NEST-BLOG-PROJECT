# What is NestJS?

## üöÄ Introduction

NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** used for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It is built on **TypeScript** (but also supports JavaScript) and uses **Express.js** (by default) or **Fastify** as the underlying HTTP server.

## üîπ Key Features

- **Modular Architecture** ‚Äì Encourages code reusability and maintainability.
- **TypeScript Support** ‚Äì Fully supports TypeScript out of the box.
- **Dependency Injection** ‚Äì Helps manage services and dependencies efficiently.
- **Built-in Middleware and Guards** ‚Äì Provides security and request handling mechanisms.
- **REST and GraphQL Support** ‚Äì Easily build APIs with decorators.
- **Microservices Compatibility** ‚Äì Works with gRPC, Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Designed for enterprise-grade applications.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

A basic NestJS project follows this structure:

```
my-nest-app/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.module.ts    # Root module
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.controller.ts # Controller for handling requests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.service.ts    # Business logic service
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                # Unit tests
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts              # Application entry point
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json         # Dependencies
```

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install NestJS CLI

```sh
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Project

```sh
nest new my-project
cd my-project
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

## üì°CREATING A NEW APPLICATION

## NestJS Module

In NestJS, a **module** is a fundamental building block that organizes the application structure. It provides a way to group related components such as services, controllers, and providers together.

### Key Elements of a Module

A module in NestJS is defined using the `@Module()` decorator, and it can include the following elements:

1. **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and map them to appropriate service methods. Example of this is users.controller.ts
2. **Providers**: Classes that provide logic, often business logic or database interactions. Services are common providers. Example of this is users.service
3. **Imports**: Other modules that are imported and made available to this module.
4. **Exports**: Providers that should be available to other modules.
5. **Exports**: Make certain providers available to other modules that import this module.

### Example of a Simple Module

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  imports: [], // Modules imported into this one
  controllers: [AppController], // Controllers in this module
  providers: [AppService], // Providers in this module
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Example of a Simple Module

You can use the commandline to create a users module.

```
nest generate module users
```

## Basic `UsersModule` in NestJS

A basic `UsersModule` in NestJS typically handles user-related functionality such as registration, authentication, and data access. Below is a structure for a basic `UsersModule`.

### Structure

1. **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to users.
2. **Service**: Contains the business logic for user-related operations.
3. **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: Defines the shape of data sent between the client and the server.
4. **Entity**: Represents the data structure for storing user information (e.g., in a database).
5. **Module**: Ties everything together.

### Example Code for a Basic `UsersModule`

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersController } from './user.controller';
import { UsersService } from './user.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [UsersController],
  providers: [UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

# CONTROLLERS IN NESTJS

In NestJS, a **controller** is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests and returns responses to the client. It acts as the entry point for all HTTP interactions, mapping specific endpoints to functions that process requests.

## Creating a Controller

Controllers in NestJS are decorated with the `@Controller()` decorator. The methods inside the controller are decorated with HTTP request decorators like `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, and `@Delete()` to map them to specific HTTP methods.

### Example:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return 'This will return all users';
  }
}
